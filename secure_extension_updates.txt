Browser Extension Audit  
How to Update Extensions Securely

Browser: Google Chrome  
Objective: Ensure browser extensions are updated safely without compromising security.

Safe Update Practices:

1. Use Built-in Browser Update Mechanism  
   - Chrome auto-updates extensions periodically.  
   - To manually update:  
     - Go to chrome://extensions/  
     - Enable Developer Mode (top right)  
     - Click the Update button

2. Avoid Manual .crx Downloads  
   - Do not install or update extensions via third-party .crx files unless verified.  
   - These can bypass Chrome’s security checks and introduce malware.

3. Verify Extension Source Before Updating  
   - Confirm the extension is still published by the original developer.  
   - Watch out for impersonation or rebranding scams.

4. Review Permissions After Update  
   - Some updates may request new permissions.  
   - Chrome will notify you—review carefully before accepting.

5. Check Changelog or Update Notes  
   - Visit the extension’s Chrome Web Store page.  
   - Review version history or changelog to understand what changed.

6. Use Antivirus or Browser Security Tools  
   - Scan updated extensions for suspicious behavior.  
   - Enable browser warnings for risky updates.

Notes:
Regular updates improve security and performance, but always validate source and permissions before accepting changes.
