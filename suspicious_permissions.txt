Day 7 Task 7 – Browser Extension Audit  
 - What Permissions Should Raise Suspicion?

Browser: Google Chrome  
Objective: Identify high-risk extension permissions that may compromise privacy or security.

Suspicious Permissions:

1. “Read and change all your data on the websites you visit”  
   - Risk: Can monitor login forms, capture credentials, inject ads, or track browsing behavior.

2. “Access your clipboard”  
   - Risk: May read copied passwords, tokens, or sensitive text.

3. “Capture content of your screen”  
   - Risk: Can record sensitive information including passwords, messages, or private documents.

4. “Access your tabs and browsing activity”  
   - Risk: Can track which sites you visit, how long you stay, and what you click.

5. “Manage your downloads”  
   - Risk: Can download malicious files or interfere with legitimate downloads.

6. “Communicate with cooperating native applications”  
   - Risk: May bridge to system-level apps, increasing attack surface and bypassing browser sandboxing.

Recommendations:
- Always review permissions before installing any extension.
- Avoid extensions that request more access than necessary.
- Remove extensions that ask for sensitive permissions without a clear, justified purpose.
