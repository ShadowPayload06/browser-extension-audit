Browser: Google Chrome  
Objective: Understand best practices for safe extension installation.

Safe Installation Guidelines:

1. Use Official Sources Only  
   - Install extensions from trusted platforms like the Chrome Web Store.  
   - Avoid third-party sites or direct .crx downloads unless verified.

2. Check Developer Reputation  
   - Prefer extensions from known developers or companies.  
   - Avoid vague or unfamiliar publisher names.

3. Read Reviews and Ratings  
   - Scan user feedback for issues like data leaks, ads, or performance drops.  
   - Prioritize extensions with consistent positive reviews.

4. Review Permissions Before Installing  
   - Check what data the extension can access (e.g., tabs, clipboard, browsing history).  
   - Avoid extensions requesting excessive or unrelated permissions.

5. Verify Update Frequency  
   - Choose extensions that are actively maintained.  
   - Avoid those not updated for long periods.

6. Limit the Number of Extensions  
   - Install only what’s necessary to reduce attack surface and improve performance.

7. Use Antivirus or Browser Security Tools  
   - Enable browser warnings for suspicious extensions.  
   - Use tools like McAfee WebAdvisor or Chrome’s built-in safety checks.
