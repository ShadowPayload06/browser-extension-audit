Browser Extension Audit  
 - What Is Extension Sandboxing?

Browser: Google Chrome  
Objective: Understand the concept of sandboxing in browser extensions.

Definition:
Extension sandboxing is a security technique used by browsers to isolate each extension in a restricted environment. This prevents extensions from accessing sensitive system resources or interfering with other extensions.

Key Features:
- Isolation: Each extension runs in its own sandbox, separate from browser core and other extensions.
- Limited Access: Extensions can only access data and APIs they’ve been explicitly granted permission for.
- Crash Containment: Misbehaving extensions are contained and do not affect browser stability.
- Security Boundaries: Prevents unauthorized access to system files, passwords, or private data.

Importance:
- Protects users from malicious extensions that attempt to steal data or inject ads.
- Enforces least privilege by limiting extension capabilities.
- Improves browser performance and reliability.

Notes:
Sandboxing is a core part of Chrome’s extension architecture and is critical for maintaining user privacy and system integrity.
