Browser Extension Audit  
  - Can Extensions Steal Passwords?
 
Browser: Google Chrome  
Objective: Understand how browser extensions can compromise password security.

Answer:
Yes, browser extensions can steal passwords if they are malicious or granted excessive permissions.

How It Happens:
- Access to Webpage Content: Extensions with permission to “read and change all your data on websites” can monitor login forms and capture credentials.
- Keystroke Logging: Malicious extensions can log typed input, including usernames and passwords.
- Session Hijacking: Extensions may steal cookies or session tokens to impersonate users.
- Clipboard Access: Extensions with clipboard permissions can read copied passwords.

Prevention Tips:
- Install extensions only from trusted sources like the Chrome Web Store.
- Review permissions before installing—avoid extensions that request access to all site data.
- Use browser security warnings and antivirus tools to detect risky behavior.
- Limit the number of installed extensions to reduce attack surface.

Notes:
Always treat browser extensions as potential security risks. Apply least privilege principles and audit extensions regularly.
